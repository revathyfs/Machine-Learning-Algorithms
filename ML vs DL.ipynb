    "## 🔹 1. Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine Learning is about writing **algorithms that learn from data**.\n",
    "* The system needs **manual feature engineering** → humans decide what features are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input data** (structured, tabular).\n",
    "2. **Feature extraction** → *done manually* (e.g., selecting “number of bedrooms” and “square footage” for house price prediction).\n",
    "3. **Algorithm learns mapping** between input features and output.\n",
    "4. **Prediction** on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best For**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured/tabular data** (rows and columns).\n",
    "* When dataset size is **small to medium**.\n",
    "* Problems where domain knowledge helps design features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicting credit risk from financial history.\n",
    "* Email spam filtering.\n",
    "* Predicting exam scores from study hours.\n",

    "## 🔹 2. Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **subset of ML** that uses **Artificial Neural Networks** with many layers.\n",
    "* **Automatic feature extraction** → raw data goes directly into the network, and it learns the features by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input data** (images, text, audio, videos, or even large structured data).\n",
    "2. **Neural network layers** automatically detect patterns (e.g., edges → shapes → objects in an image).\n",
    "3. **Prediction** based on learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best For**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unstructured data** (images, text, audio, video).\n",
    "* Large datasets (thousands to millions of samples).\n",
    "* High computational power (requires GPUs/TPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Face recognition (phones, social media).\n",
    "* Speech-to-text systems (Alexa, Google Voice).\n",

    "* **ML = Chef with ingredients prepared**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You (the human) chop vegetables, measure spices (features).\n",
    "  * The chef (ML algorithm) cooks using those inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DL = Chef + Assistant robots**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The robot itself washes, chops, prepares (feature extraction).\n",
    "  * The chef (deep network) directly cooks the final dish.\n",

    "## 🔹 5. Example: Image Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Learning Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Step 1: Extract edges, color histograms, texture (manual features).\n",
    "  * Step 2: Feed these features into ML model (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression).\n",
    "  * Step 3: Predict whether image = “cat” or “dog”.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deep Learning Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Step 1: Feed raw image pixels directly into a neural network (CNN).\n",
    "  * Step 2: The network automatically learns edges → patterns → shapes → object.\n",
    "  * Step 3: Predicts “cat” or “dog”.\n",

    "\n",
    "* ✅ Use **Machine Learning** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You have **small/medium datasets**.\n",
    "  * Data is structured (CSV, Excel tables).\n",
    "  * You need **fast, interpretable models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Use **Deep Learning** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You have **large amounts of unstructured data** (images, video, text).\n",
    "  * You have **GPUs/TPUs** for training.\n",
    "  * Accuracy is more important than interpretability.\n",
