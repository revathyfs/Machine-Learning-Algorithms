    "## üîπ Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI is the **broad field** of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can **mimic human intelligence**.\n",
    "* The ultimate goal: make machines capable of **reasoning, decision-making, problem-solving, perception, and learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of programming every step ‚Üí AI systems can adapt and decide what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-driving cars**: Recognize pedestrians, traffic signs, make driving decisions.\n",
    "* **Virtual assistants**: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant ‚Üí understand voice, respond.\n",
    "* **Robotics**: Industrial robots optimizing workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Think of **AI as the parent field** that includes ML, DL, and other methods like expert systems, rule-based systems, search algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ML is a **subset of AI**.\n",
    "* Machines **learn from data** by identifying patterns and improving with experience ‚Äî without needing explicit programming for every rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input: Historical data.\n",
    "* Process: Algorithms detect relationships/patterns.\n",
    "* Output: Predictions or classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spam detection** in Gmail ‚Üí learns from labeled examples (spam vs. not spam).\n",
    "* **House price prediction** ‚Üí learns relationship between size, location, price.\n",
    "* **Fraud detection** ‚Üí identifies unusual transaction patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Difference vs AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI = intelligence broadly.\n",
    "* ML = the way machines **achieve intelligence** by learning from data.\n",

    "## üîπ Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* DL is a **subset of ML**.\n",
    "* Uses **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** with many hidden layers (‚Äúdeep‚Äù layers).\n",
    "* Inspired by how the human brain processes information through neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Special?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike traditional ML, DL can **automatically extract features** from raw data.\n",
    "* Handles **complex, unstructured data** like images, video, audio, and natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Face recognition** on Facebook/phones.\n",
    "* **Voice-to-text** in Alexa, Google Voice.\n",
    "* **Autonomous driving**: Detecting objects, lanes, pedestrians.\n",

    "## üîπ Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Science is an **interdisciplinary field** that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Mathematics & Statistics** ‚Üí understanding data.\n",
    "  2. **Programming** ‚Üí handling & analyzing data.\n",
    "  3. **ML/DL** ‚Üí building predictive models.\n",
    "  4. **Domain knowledge** ‚Üí applying results to real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Data Scientists Do**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collect and clean data.\n",
    "* Explore data with statistics & visualization.\n",
    "* Apply ML/DL algorithms.\n",
    "* Interpret results and **communicate insights** to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Netflix recommendations**: Suggest shows based on viewing history.\n",
    "* **Amazon product suggestions**: Predict what users might buy.\n",
    "* **Business forecasting**: Predicting sales, demand, customer churn.\n",
